- ## Description
Our project is based on training 3 different ML models for three different representations of a data set. And finally training another model combining all three data sets to try getting better accuracy. 

We are training the model for emoticon data set in the main code itself , where as for the deep features dataset , text sequence  datasets and the combined model we are loading the saved models  and also attaching the code which trained the model.
- ## Steps
On running our file named “7.py” which contains all the trained models you will be asked 4 prompts :

1. Please provide path to the training dataset of emoticon dataset:
1. Please provide path to the testing dataset of emoticon dataset:
1. Please provide path to the testing dataset of deep features dataset:
1. Please provide path to the testing dataset of text sequence dataset:

On providing the respective paths the code produces 4 .txt files each one with predictions on different data sets and one with the combined model.
- ## Libraries required 
The following are the libraries which will be required to run the “7.py” file :

1. NumPy
1. Pandas
1. Scikit-learn
1. Joblib
1. Pickle
1. Keras
- ## Files contained in the zip
1. Pdf report in latex template.
1. File “7.py” which is the main code.
1. Additional files which contains saved models, scalers and prompts in  .pkl and .joblib format.
1. Additional  .ipynb files which contains the code which trained the model.
1. Final predictions of all the models on test dataset in .txt format.
